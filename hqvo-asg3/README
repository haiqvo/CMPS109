HW3 Bidirectional Shortest Path algorithm.
*************************************************************

*WARNING THERE IS A LONG RUN TIME*
*IT WORKS*

The assignment is to use asg2's graph class and perform 
a bidirectional search on it. The first thing that change is 
the 2D vector is changed into a edge list. There are also two
functions one normal dijkstra and on bidirectional dijkstra, they
are used to test the differents between the two make performing
200 search each.

this assignment involve learning how to use find_if, sets, pair, 
and clock. I also learn how to make a bidirectional search. Sets 
and pairs could have been switched with queues.    

How To Run:
Unzip it to a folder and make sure the Makefile and graph.cc file
is in the same folder than go to the console and cd into the 
folder and type 'gmake all'.
