Converting monte carlo integration for pi C program to C++
*************************************************************
The assignment is to convert Monte Carlo's C program to a 
C++ program. Changing the comment to a // format, fixing the 
header, changing the array to C++'s vector, and fixing the 
print statements.

In this assignment I learn about namespaces and how to use it 
in C++. I also learned about how to cast a type in C++ and finally 
how to use vectors in C++ instead of now arrays.

How To Run:
Unzip it to a folder and make sure the Makefile and pi.cc file
is in the same folder than go to the console and cd into the 
folder and type 'gmake all'.
