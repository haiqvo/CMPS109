HW4 HEX BOARD
*************************************************************

This assignment is to make a hex board and fill it up will turns
made by 2 player in this example I chose black and white pieces. So 
to make it easier for the next step the program already keeps track 
of the neighbors by pointing to it to make it easier to determine a 
winner. 

How To Run:
Unzip it to a folder and make sure the Makefile and hexboard.cc file
is in the same folder than go to the console and cd into the 
folder and type 'gmake all'.
